/* *********************************************************************
* This example demonstrates how you can write your own updaters and
* analyzers and use them together with the task manager. The example
* program is not much different to the previous one. The difference here
* is that we use an updater to create particles, and we write an analyzer
* by ourself.
* The example updater and analyzer are in the files
* ex5updater.h and ex5analyzer.h
*
* After finishing this example tutorial, take a look into the analyzers
* and updaters provided in src/updaters and src/analyzers. You now
* have the tools to understand their structure and how they work.

      * as compared to the previous example, we now don't create the
      * particles by hand, but we use an updater for this in the
      * task manager. the advantage of this approach is that you can
      * reuse this updater in different programs, so you don't have to
      * write the code for creating particles every time.
      *
      * we want the particles to be created once before the simulation.
      * so we have to tell the task manager this when adding the
      * updater. this is done by giving the number 0 as execution
      * frequency, as shown below.
      * the largest part of the code below is exactly the same as in the
      * previous example.

    //again, the addUpdater function takes two arguments. The first one
    //is a pointer to the updater, and the second one is the execution
    //frequency. here we use 0 as frequency, because we want the updater
    //to be executed only once at the beginning.
    //what would happen, if you set a number different from 0?

    //cycle
    taskmanager.addUpdater(new

    //the following two analyzers are the same as in the last example:
    //on top of this, we add a third one, which is the ex5analyzer
    //written for this example.

    //add the file output, the trajectory file name will be "polymer.bfm"
    taskmanager.addAnalyzer(new
    AnalyzerWriteBfmFile<MyIngredients>("polymer.bfm",mySystem),1);

    //add the radius of gyration calculation. we execute this only
    //every 10th time
    taskmanager.addAnalyzer(new
    AnalyzerRadiusOfGyration<MyIngredients>(mySystem,"Rg2.dat"),10);

    //now add the ex5analyzer. execute it every second cycle
    std::string outputFilename("ex5output.dat");
    taskmanager.addAnalyzer(new Ex5Analyzer<MyIngredients>(mySystem,outputFilename),2);

    //as before, we initialize and run the task manager, and cleanup afterwards
